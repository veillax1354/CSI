## What is CSI?  
CSI (Canvas Spreadsheet Integration) is a custom script designed for seamlessly retrieving Canvas data automatically. Initially developed to create an organized checklist for assignments and facilitate comprehensive tracking of due dates, CSI has evolved into a robust tool.

The script automates the retrieval and update of course-related information from the Canvas API, seamlessly integrating it into a Google Spreadsheet. It efficiently categorizes data into distinct sheets for each course, implements conditional formatting, and improves visual comprehension through alternating row colors. Primarily tailored for individuals enrolled in Canvas courses, CSI offers an efficient solution for managing and monitoring assignments, ensuring a hassle-free approach to staying on top of due dates and course-related details.
